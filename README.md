# Student marks 
## problem statement
---------------------
There are N number of student in the class. Each student has three compulsory subjects and 2 additional subjects. List of Compulsory Subjects are: Math, Phy, Chem. And list of Additional Subjects are: Bio, Comp, Sports, English. All the subjects are  tested in 100 marks. Each student will get some marks in the exam. So design a java class or a set of classes which could prepare the result of the class. Result should be able to answer who are first second third all together? Who are first second third in a specific subject? Who are first second third in a specific subject combination of any number ( like show me top3 having Math and Phy or Math and English and Sports). Give proper prompt for the query.
